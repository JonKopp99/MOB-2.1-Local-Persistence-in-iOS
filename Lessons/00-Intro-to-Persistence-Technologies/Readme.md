## Overview (20 min)

## In Class Activity I (30 min)
### Advanced Persistence Technologies

#### Core Data, Realm, SQLite
- Querying / selecting a subset of object graph
- Saving individual objects independent of entire graph
- Simple versioning of data model


### Secure(Sensitive) data storage
- Keeping sensitive information in iOS

### FileSystem
- Visualize the iOS filesystem and leverage it to store information
- Understand when storing information using the raw filesystem is a better option
